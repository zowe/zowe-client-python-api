Core Package
============

The Zowe Client Pyton SDK Core package contains functionality that is shared across all other SDK packages, such as `@zowe/zos-files-for-zowe-sdk`.  

<strong>Important!</strong> You must install the Core package to satisfy the peer dependency requirement for all other SDK packages.

Examples of modules, included in this package, and description of the functionality that they provide:

or by passing an `ISession` object with session parameters.
  

- <em>sdk_api</em> - Defines the `SdkApi` class, representing the base SDK API.
  

- <em>profile_manager</em> - Defines the `ProfileManager` class. It contains methods such as `autodiscover_config_dir`,
